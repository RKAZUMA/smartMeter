- use the server global object on the client side... e.g. to distinguish between v39 and entrance.leichsenring.net...
- the smartmeter Simulator should not write values to the datafile but rather just flip gpio-pins from time to time
- therefore the smartmeter.js should not need to distinguish between darwin and rpi...
- therefore the test setup for darwin should be part of the simulator...

?!? Problem: on an rpi I want to test and yet not write to an input gpio...?!?
Idea: I I leave it as it is for rpi and only on darwin the simulator will write to the simulated gpio device. ...
- solved by introducing the testmode object in the global directory
--> next: initialize the global object depending on weather the caller id war someting testy or production...
	I think, i just discovered that I have at least 4 Systems.
	1. Development System
	2. Dev- Test
	3. Prod- Test
	4. Production 

- put global values from smartmeter.json to global.json
- repair the title div in getEnergyObject.js
- only log data values > 1 Watt, i.e. remove the enty at startup time... and maybe reboot 
- acslogo von S. Tilkov ansehen...
- find out, why the global object is initialized so early and by whom... --> there was an uneccesary init() call in global.js
